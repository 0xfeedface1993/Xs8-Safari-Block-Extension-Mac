# Xs8-Safari-Block-Extension-Mac
This is my safari block extension for Mac. It block the terrible AD on the sex8.cc(you know what it is ^_^). I know there has ADBlock or something extension like ADBlock, but no good support for this website,  wish you like it!

# How to Use ?
1. Download my project, than open it, find Signed tab and change to your developer account (don't forgot change bundle id).
2. Build Project, Run it!
3. It would be new Safari open, click Safari->Preference->Extensions on menu bar, find ADBlock and check it!
4. All right, just goto sec8.cc!

# There will be iOS version for it!
