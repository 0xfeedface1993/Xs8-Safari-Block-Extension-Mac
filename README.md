# Xs8-Safari-Block-Extension-Mac
This is my safari block extension for Mac. It block the terrible AD on the sex8.cc(you know what it is ^_^). I know there has ADBlock or something extension like ADBlock, but no good support for this website,  wish you like it!

# How to Use ?
1. Download my project, than open it, find Signed tab and change to your developer account (don't forgot change bundle id).
2. Build Project, Run it!
3. It would be new Safari open, click **Safari->Preference->Extensions** on menu bar, find **ADBlock** and To** Torrilste**, check it! OR just run the App in the project, than enable **ADBlock** and To **Torrilste** extension in your Safari.
4. All right, just goto sec8.cc, All bad ads gone!
5. Try to visit **网盘下载区 | Disk Download** section, open some interested post, click it, when web content load done, clik the left button **莕** of search area, you will see save info in left-top of web content(red background & white text mean successful, other wise failed).
6. open the App, you can see the post info & images.

# There will be iOS version for it, Just wait and see!
